I used the following IDE and technologies to execute the web automation tests:

- IntelliJ IDE to writing the code
- Java, Cucumber, Gherkin and Selenium web driver to write the tests and execute them

As you can see I only implement the web test related to the acceptance criteria TC001. I tried to continue the automation challenging but I don't have
experience with Web services testing with Java. The only experience that I had was a long time a go and the automation was done with Javascript and Postman IDE.

About the manual exploratory testing, I reported an bug. The file name is "Issue Report"

To execute the automation web tests, is only necessary You have the Web Driver on you machine and put the right path on (src>main>java>screenRetails>TC001)

IF you have any question, please let me know.
